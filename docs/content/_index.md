The JMX Exporter is a pair collectors to capture JMX MBean metric values.

### Java Agent

The JMX Exporter Java agent provides access to JMX metrics running as a Java agent within your application.

**Use of the JMX Exporter Java agent is strongly encouraged due to the complex application RMI configuration required when running the Standalone JMX Exporter.**

### Standalone

The Standalone JMX Exporter runs as a separate application that connects to your application using RMI and collects JMX MBean metrics.
