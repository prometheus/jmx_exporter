The `collector` module/library is currently published to Maven Central and used as a dependency for some projects.

# Support Statement

The `collector` module/library is designed to serve as an internal project library, and its functionality is specifically tailored for use within the scope of the JMX Exporter.

As such, it is important to note the following:

- This module is intended for internal use within the JMX Exporter.


- It is not _designed_ for consumption as a standalone library or for external integration.


- No Guaranteed API Contract
  - The module does not provide API documentation or formal API contracts. The package structure, class names, method names, and method signatures are subject to change without notice, based on evolving project needs.

- Backward Compatibility
  - There is no guarantee of backward compatibility. Updates to the module may introduce breaking changes to existing functionality.

### Support Scope

Support for the `collector` module/library is limited outside of the JMX Exporter.

Questions or issues should be addressed to the JMX Exporter maintainers.
