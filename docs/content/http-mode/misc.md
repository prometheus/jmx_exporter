- By default, a maximum of 10 threads is used

### Configuration

```yaml
httpServer:
  threads:
    minimum: 1
    maximum: 10
    keepAliveTime: 120 # seconds
```

- `minimum` - minimum number of threads
- `maximum` - maximum number of threads
- `keepAliveTime` - thread keep-alive time in seconds

**Notes**

- If the work queue is full, the request will be blocked until space is available in the work queue for the request
